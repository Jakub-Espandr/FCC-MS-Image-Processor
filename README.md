## Overview

The **FlyCamCzech MultiSpectral Image Processor (FCC MS Image Processor)** is a powerful and user-friendly application designed for analyzing multispectral UAV imagery. Developed as part of the thesis of **Bc. Jakub Ešpandr** (*Classification of UAV Image Data within Selected Areas*), the software allows for intuitive calculation, visualization, and export of over 50 vegetation indices.

Originally developed for scientific and environmental monitoring purposes, the tool is now accessible via a modern **web interface**, usable from any device with a browser.

## Key Features

- 🌱 **Vegetation Index Calculation**  
  Supports more than **50 spectral indices** used in plant health and land cover analysis (NDVI, GNDVI, CIg, SAVI, VARI...).
  
- 🖼️ **Multispectral Image Import**  
  Load aligned image bands from modified camera setups or UAV sensors.

- 📊 **Visualization Tools**  
  Real-time display of processed indices using colormaps and overlays.

- 💾 **Data Export**  
  Save results as processed images or raw data for further analysis.

- 🌐 **Web Interface**  
  The entire app runs in-browser via a lightweight Python web server.
