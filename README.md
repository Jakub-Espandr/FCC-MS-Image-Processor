FlyCamCzech MultiSpectral Image Processor

FlyCamCzech MultiSpectral Image Processor (FCC MS Image Processor) is a sophisticated application developed to analyze multispectral images obtained from modified camera systems. The primary objective of this application is to generate key vegetation indices that are essential for scientific research and vegetation monitoring. This application is part of the thesis of Bc. Jakub Ešpandr entitled Classification of UAV image data within selected areas (Klasifikace UAV obrazových dat v rámci vybraných území).

The application is designed to serve primarily enthusiasts who specialize in vegetation analysis using multispectral imagery. The main functionalities and features of the application include:
- Import of multispectral imagery.
- The application supports the calculation of the following vegetation indices:
- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- ENDVI (Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- TVI (Transformed Vegetation Index)
- GNDVI (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- MSAVI (Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- CVI (Chlorophyll Vegetation Index)
- CVI2 (Enhanced Chlorophyll Vegetation Index)
- PRI (Photochemical Reflectance Index)
- NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)
- VARI (Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index)
- EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)
- NG (Normalized Green Index)


Visualization of results.
- Exporting results: the resulting images and data can be exported for further analysis and processing.

The application uses modern technologies such as Python for image data processing and analysis, OpenCV for image manipulation and calculation of vegetation indices, Matplotlib for visualization of results and GUI libraries (Tkinter or PyQt) for intuitive user interface.

The uniqueness of the application lies in its simple and user-friendly interface that facilitates the analysis of multispectral images, which is commonly considered a complex and technically demanding process. The application is designed to be accessible even to users with limited experience in image data analysis, thus greatly simplifying the process of calculating and interpreting vegetation indices from multispectral imagery. This enables faster and more efficient vegetation analysis, which is crucial for research in agriculture, ecology and environmental sciences.

Future development of the application includes extending support for additional vegetation indices (e.g. EVI - Enhanced Vegetation Index) and improving the user interface to increase the comfort and efficiency of working with the application.
