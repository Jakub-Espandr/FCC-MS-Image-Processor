FlyCamCzech MultiSpectral Image Processor

FlyCamCzech MultiSpectral Image Processor (FCC MS Image Processor) is a sophisticated application developed to analyze multispectral images obtained from modified camera systems. The primary objective of this application is to generate key vegetation indices that are essential for scientific research and vegetation monitoring. This application is part of the thesis of Bc. Jakub Ešpandr entitled Classification of UAV Image Data within Selected Areas (Klasifikace UAV obrazových dat v rámci vybraných území).

The application is designed to serve primarily enthusiasts who specialize in vegetation analysis using multispectral imagery. The main functionalities and features of the application include:

Visualization of results.
- Exporting results: the resulting images and data can be exported for further analysis and processing.

New Features:

Web Server Deployment: The application now runs on a web server, making it accessible from any device with an internet connection.
Enhanced Options: Added new features to provide more options and flexibility for users.
The application uses modern technologies such as Python for image data processing and analysis, OpenCV for image manipulation and calculation of vegetation indices, Matplotlib for visualization of results, and GUI libraries (Tkinter or PyQt) for an intuitive user interface.

The uniqueness of the application lies in its simple and user-friendly interface that facilitates the analysis of multispectral images, which is commonly considered a complex and technically demanding process. The application is designed to be accessible even to users with limited experience in image data analysis, greatly simplifying the process of calculating and interpreting vegetation indices from multispectral imagery. This enables faster and more efficient vegetation analysis, crucial for research in agriculture, ecology, and environmental sciences.

Future Development:

Extending support for additional vegetation indices.
Adding new handy features.
Improving the user interface to increase the comfort and efficiency of working with the application.
